/**
 * The decoder implementation is currently limited to Linear PCM encoded
 * audio data with one or two channels of 8- or 16-bit samples at sample
 * rates from 100 Hz to 96 kHz.  The number of channels is limited by what
 * the audio backend (sydneyaudio via nsAudioStream) currently supports.  The
 * supported sample rate is artificially limited to arbitrarily selected sane
 * values.  Support for additional channels (and other new features) would
 * require extending nsWaveDecoder to support parsing the newer
 * WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE chunk format.
