/**
 * Call aCallback for the C/C++ stack frames on the current thread, from
 * the caller of NS_StackWalk to main (or above).
 *
 * @param aCallback    Callback function, called once per frame.
 * @param aSkipFrames  Number of initial frames to skip.  0 means that
 *                     the first callback will be for the caller of
 *                     NS_StackWalk.
 * @param aClosure     Caller-supplied data passed through to aCallback.
 * @param aThread      The thread for which the stack is to be retrieved.
 *                     Passing null causes us to walk the stack of the
 *                     current thread. On Windows, this is a thread HANDLE.
 *                     It is currently not supported on any other platform.
 *
 * Returns NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED on platforms where it is
 * unimplemented.
 * Returns NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED when the stack indicates that the thread
 * is in a very dangerous situation (e.g., holding sem_pool_lock in 
 * Mac OS X pthreads code). Callers should then bail out immediately.
 *
 * May skip some stack frames due to compiler optimizations or code
 * generation.
