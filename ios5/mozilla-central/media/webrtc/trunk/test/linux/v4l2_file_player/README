This is a simple program which can feed raw video data into a V4L2 sink, such as
the v4l2loopback driver. See the .c file for implementation notes and how to run
the program.

You will require the gstreamer developer package and the "bad" plugin set for
gstreamer. The easiest way to get this is to run

sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad libgstreamer0.10-dev

Then just build using make in this directory.
