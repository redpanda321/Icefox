This test will pop up a browser with two tabs, and will run video from
one tab to the other tab, across the local network interface.

In order to run this test, you need to have:

- an installed lighttpd in your $PATH
- a built peerconnection_server
- a sufficiently new google-chrome binary with WebRTC support.

To build peerconnection_server, refer to peerconnection_server/README. This
script will assume you have a directory structure like so:

- webrtc/trunk/
- peerconnection/trunk

That is, the script assumes it will find a peerconnection_server binary in
../../../../peerconnection/out/Debug/ relative to the sanity check
directory. If this doesn't suit you, feel free to change the script locally.

You need to run the script from the test/sanity_check directory. The first time
you run it, you will be asked to choose a search engine. Additionally, you will
have to let Chrome access your webcam by accepting the notice at the top.

This script uses the webrtc_test.html code, which is described by its own
README in the www/html directory.
