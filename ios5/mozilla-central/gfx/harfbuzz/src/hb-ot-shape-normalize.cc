/*
 * HIGHLEVEL DESIGN:
 *
 * This file exports one main function: _hb_ot_shape_normalize().
 *
 * This function closely reflects the Unicode Normalization Algorithm,
 * yet it's different.
 *
 * Each shaper specifies whether it prefers decomposed (NFD) or composed (NFC).
 * The logic however tries to use whatever the font can support.
 *
 * In general what happens is that: each grapheme is decomposed in a chain
 * of 1:2 decompositions, marks reordered, and then recomposed if desired,
 * so far it's like Unicode Normalization.  However, the decomposition and
 * recomposition only happens if the font supports the resulting characters.
 *
 * The goals are:
 *
 *   - Try to render all canonically equivalent strings similarly.  To really
 *     achieve this we have to always do the full decomposition and then
 *     selectively recompose from there.  It's kinda too expensive though, so
 *     we skip some cases.  For example, if composed is desired, we simply
 *     don't touch 1-character clusters that are supported by the font, even
 *     though their NFC may be different.
 *
 *   - When a font has a precomposed character for a sequence but the 'ccmp'
 *     feature in the font is not adequate, use the precomposed character
 *     which typically has better mark positioning.
 *
 *   - When a font does not support a combining mark, but supports it precomposed
 *     with previous base, use that.  This needs the itemizer to have this
 *     knowledge too.  We need to provide assistance to the itemizer.
 *
 *   - When a font does not support a character but supports its decomposition,
 *     well, use the decomposition.
 *
 *   - The Indic shaper requests decomposed output.  This will handle splitting
 *     matra for the Indic shaper.
