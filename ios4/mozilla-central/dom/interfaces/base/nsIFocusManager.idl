/**
 * The focus manager deals with all focus related behaviour. Only one element
 * in the entire application may have the focus at a time; this element
 * receives any keyboard events. While there is only one application-wide
 * focused element, each nsIDOMWindow maintains a reference to the element
 * that would be focused if the window was active.
 *
 * If the window's reference is to a frame element (iframe, browser,
 * editor), then the child window contains the element that is currently
 * focused. If the window's reference is to a root element, then the root is
 * focused. If a window's reference is null, then no element is focused, yet
 * the window is still focused.
 *
 * The blur event is fired on an element when it loses the application focus.
 * After this blur event, if the focus is moving away from a document, two
 * additional blur events are fired on the old document and window containing
 * the focus respectively.
 *
 * When a new document is focused, two focus events are fired on the new
 * document and window respectively. Then the focus event is fired on an
 * element when it gains the application focus.
 *
 * A special case is that the root element may be focused, yet does not
 * receive the element focus and blur events. Instead a focus outline may be
 * drawn around the document.
 *
 * Blur and focus events do not bubble as per the W3C DOM Events spec.
