/*
 * nsIWinTaskbar
 *
 * This interface represents a service which exposes the APIs provided by the
 * Windows taskbar to applications.
 *
 * Starting in Windows 7, applications gain some control over their appearance
 * in the taskbar. By default, there is one taskbar preview per top level
 * window (excluding popups). This preview is represented by an
 * nsITaskbarWindowPreview object.
 *
 * An application can register its own "tab" previews. Such previews will hide
 * the corresponding nsITaskbarWindowPreview automatically (though this is not
 * reflected in the visible attribute of the nsITaskbarWindowPreview). These
 * tab previews do not have to correspond to tabs in the application - they can
 * vary in size, shape and location. They do not even need to be actual GUI
 * elements on the window. Unlike window previews, tab previews require most of
 * the functionality of the nsITaskbarPreviewController to be implemented.
 *
 * Applications can also show progress on their taskbar icon. This does not
 * interact with the taskbar previews except if the nsITaskbarWindowPreview is
 * made invisible in which case the progress is naturally not shown on that
 * window.
 *
 * When taskbar icons are combined as is the default in Windows 7, the progress
 * for those windows is also combined as defined here:
 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd391697%28VS.85%29.aspx
 *
 * Applications may also define custom taskbar jump lists on application shortcuts.
 * See nsIJumpListBuilder for more information.
