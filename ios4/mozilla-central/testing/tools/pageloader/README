This is a pageloader extension for Firefox. It cycles through a list of URLs 
specified in a text file by the user (one URL per line), and reports statistics
and raw data about the time each page took to load.

This data is dumped to the console, so the browser.dom.window.dump.enabled pref
(boolean) must be set to "true", and on Windows Firefox must be run with the
"-console" command line switch.

This test is intended to be run standalone from a chrome URL, e.g.:
firefox -chrome chrome://pageloader/content/pageloader.xul

The window will close and the data will be dumped to the console when the
test has completed.
