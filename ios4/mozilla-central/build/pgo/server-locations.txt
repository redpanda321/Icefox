# This file defines the locations at which this HTTP server may be accessed.
# It is referred to by the following page, so if this file moves, that page must
# be modified accordingly:
#
# http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mochitest#How_do_I_test_issues_which_only_show_up_when_tests_are_run_across_domains.3F
#
# Empty lines and lines which begin with "#" are ignored and may be used for
# storing comments.  All other lines consist of an origin followed by whitespace
# and a comma-separated list of options (if indeed any options are needed).
#
# The format of an origin is, referring to RFC 2396, a scheme (either "http" or
# "https"), followed by "://", followed by a host, followed by ":", followed by
# a port number.  The colon and port number must be present even if the port
# number is the default for the protocol.
#
# Unrecognized options are ignored.  Recognized options are "primary" and
# "privileged", "nocert", "cert=some_cert_nickname". 
#
# "primary" denotes a location which is the canonical location of
# the server; this location is the one assumed for requests which don't
# otherwise identify a particular origin (e.g. HTTP/1.0 requests).  
#
# "privileged" denotes a location which should have the ability to request 
# elevated privileges; the default is no privileges.
#
# "nocert" makes sense only for https:// hosts and means there is not
# any certificate automatically generated for this host.
#
# "cert=nickname" tells the pgo server to use a particular certificate
# for this host. The certificate is referenced by its nickname that must
# not contain any spaces. The certificate  key files (PKCS12 modules)
# for custom certification are loaded from build/pgo/ssltunnel/certs
# directory. When new certificate is added to this dir pgo/ssltunnel
# must be builded then.
#

#
# This is the primary location from which tests run.

#
# These are a common set of prefixes scattered across one TLD with two ports and
# another TLD on a single port.

# These hosts are used in tests which exercise privilege-granting functionality;
# we could reuse some of the names above, but specific names make it easier to
# distinguish one from the other in tests (as well as what functionality is
