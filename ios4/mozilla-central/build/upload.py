# When run directly, this script expects the following environment variables
# to be set:
# UPLOAD_HOST    : host to upload files to
# UPLOAD_USER    : username on that host
# UPLOAD_PATH    : path on that host to put the files in
#
# And will use the following optional environment variables if set:
# UPLOAD_SSH_KEY : path to a ssh private key to use
# UPLOAD_PORT    : port to use for ssh
# POST_UPLOAD_CMD: a commandline to run on the remote host after uploading.
#                  UPLOAD_PATH and the full paths of all files uploaded will
#                  be appended to the commandline.
#
# All files to be uploaded should be passed as commandline arguments to this
# script. The script takes one other parameter, --base-path, which you can use
# to indicate that files should be uploaded including their paths relative
# to the base path.
