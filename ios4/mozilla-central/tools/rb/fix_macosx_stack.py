# This script uses atos to process the output of nsTraceRefcnt's Mac OS
# X stack walking code.  This is useful for two things:
#  (1) Getting line number information out of
#      |nsTraceRefcntImpl::WalkTheStack|'s output in debug builds.
#  (2) Getting function names out of |nsTraceRefcntImpl::WalkTheStack|'s
#      output on all builds (where it mostly prints UNKNOWN because only
#      a handful of symbols are exported from component libraries).
#
# Use the script by piping output containing stacks (such as raw stacks
# or make-tree.pl balance trees) through this script.
