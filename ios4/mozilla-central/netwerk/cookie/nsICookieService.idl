/**

 *
 * Provides methods for setting and getting cookies in the context of a
 * page load.  See nsICookieManager for methods to manipulate the cookie
 * database directly.  This separation of interface is mainly historical.
 *
 * This service broadcasts the following notifications when the cookie
 * list is changed, or a cookie is rejected:
 *
 * topic  : "cookie-changed"
 *          broadcast whenever the cookie list changes in some way. see
 *          explanation of data strings below.
 * subject: see below.
 * data   : "deleted"
 *          a cookie was deleted. the subject is an nsICookie2 representing
 *          the deleted cookie.
 *          "added"
 *          a cookie was added. the subject is an nsICookie2 representing
 *          the added cookie.
 *          "changed"
 *          a cookie was changed. the subject is an nsICookie2 representing
 *          the new cookie. (note that host, path, and name are invariant
 *          for a given cookie; other parameters may change.)
 *          "batch-deleted"
 *          a batch of cookies was deleted (for instance, as part of a purging
 *          operation). the subject is an nsIArray of nsICookie2's representing
 *          the deleted cookies.
 *          "cleared"
 *          the entire cookie list was cleared. the subject is null.
 *          "reload"
 *          the entire cookie list should be reloaded.  the subject is null.
 *
 * topic  : "cookie-rejected"
 *          broadcast whenever a cookie was rejected from being set as a
 *          result of user prefs.
 * subject: an nsIURI interface pointer representing the URI that attempted
 *          to set the cookie.
 * data   : none.
