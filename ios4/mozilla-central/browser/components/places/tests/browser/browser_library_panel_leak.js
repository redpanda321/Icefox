/**
 *  Bug 433231 - Places Library leaks the nsGlobalWindow when closed with a
 *               history entry selected.
 * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433231
 *
 * STRs: Open Library, select an history entry in History, close Library.
 * ISSUE: We were adding a bookmarks observer when editing a bookmark, when
 *        selecting an history entry the panel was not un-initialized, and
 *        since an histroy entry does not have an itemId, the observer was
 *        never removed.
