 * eNoBreak       The line has no break opportunities
 * eWordWrapBreak The line has a break opportunity only within a word. With
 *                word-wrap: break-word we will break at this point only if
 *                there are no other break opportunities in the line.
 * eNormalBreak   The line has a break opportunity determined by the standard
 *                line-breaking algorithm.
 *
 * Future expansion: split eNormalBreak into multiple priorities, e.g.
 *                    punctuation break and whitespace break (bug 389710).
 *                   As and when we implement it, text-wrap: unrestricted will
 *                    mean that priorities are ignored and all line-break
 *                    opportunities are equal.
