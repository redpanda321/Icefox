/**
 * nsTextEditorState is a class which is responsible for managing the state of
 * plaintext controls.  This currently includes the following HTML elements:
 *   <input type=text>
 *   <input type=password>
 *   <textarea>
 * and also XUL controls such as <textbox> which use one of these elements behind
 * the scenes.
 *
 * This class is held as a member of nsHTMLInputElement and nsHTMLTextAreaElement.
 * The public functions in this class include the public APIs which content/ uses.
 * Layout code uses the nsITextControlElement interface to invoke functions on this
 * class.
 *
 * The design motivation behind this class is maintaining all of the things which
 * collectively are considered the "state" of the text control in a single location.
 * This state includes several things:
 *
 *  * The control's value.  This value is stored in the mValue member, and is only
 *    used when there is no frame for the control, or when the editor object has
 *    not been initialized yet.
 *
 *  * The control's associated frame.  This value is stored in the mBoundFrame member.
 *    A text control might never have an associated frame during its life cycle,
 *    or might have several different ones, but at any given moment in time there is
 *    a maximum of 1 bound frame to each text control.
 *
 *  * The control's associated editor.  This value is stored in the mEditor member.
 *    An editor is initilized for the control only when necessary (that is, when either
 *    the user is about to interact with the text control, or when some other code
 *    needs to access the editor object.  Without a frame bound to the control, an
 *    editor is never initialzied.  Once initialized, the editor might outlive the frame,
 *    in which case the same editor will be used if a new frame gets bound to the
 *    text control.
 *
 *  * The anonymous content associated with the text control's frame, including the
 *    value div (the DIV element responsible for holding the value of the text control)
 *    and the placeholder div (the DIV element responsible for holding the placeholder
 *    value of the text control.)  These values are stored in the mRootNode and
 *    mPlaceholderDiv members, respectively.  They will be created when a
 *    frame is bound to the text control.  They will be destroyed when the frame is
 *    unbound from the object.  We could try and hold on to the anonymous content
 *    between different frames, but unfortunately that is not currently possible
 *    because they are not unbound from the document in time.
 *
 *  * The frame selection controller.  This value is stored in the mSelCon member.
 *    The frame selection controller is responsible for maintaining the selection state
 *    on a frame.  It is created when a frame is bound to the text control element,
 *    and will be destroy when the frame is being unbound from the text control element.
 *    It is created alongside with the frame selection object which is stored in the
 *    mFrameSel member.
 *
 *  * The editor text listener.  This value is stored in the mTextListener member.
 *    Its job is to listen to selection and keyboard events, and act accordingly.
 *    It is created when an a frame is first bound to the control, and will be destroyed
 *    when the frame is unbound from the text control element.
 *
 *  * The editor's cached value.  This value is stored in the mCachedValue member.
 *    It is used to improve the performance of append operations to the text
 *    control.  A mutation observer stored in the mAnonDivObserver has the job of
 *    invalidating this cache when the anonymous contect containing the value is
 *    changed.
 *
 *
 * As a general rule, nsTextEditorState objects own the value of the text control, and any
 * attempt to retrieve or set the value must be made through those objects.  Internally,
 * the value can be represented in several different ways, based on the state the control is
 * in.
 *
 *   * When the control is first initialized, its value is equal to the default value of
 *     the DOM node.  For <input> text controls, this default value is the value of the
 *     value attribute.  For <textarea> elements, this default value is the value of the
 *     text node children of the element.
 *
 *   * If the value has been changed through the DOM node (before the editor for the object
 *     is initialized), the value is stored as a simple string inside the mValue member of
 *     the nsTextEditorState object.
 *
 *   * If an editor has been initialized for the control, the value is set and retrievd via
 *     the nsIPlaintextEditor interface, and is internally managed by the editor as the
 *     native anonymous content tree attached to the control's frame.
 *
 *   * If the text editor state object is unbound from the control's frame, the value is
 *     transferred to the mValue member variable, and will be managed there until a new
 *     frame is bound to the text editor state object.
