/*
Each video element based on nsBuiltinDecoder has at least one thread
dedicated to decoding video.

This thread (called the state machine thread owns the resources for
downloading and reading the media file. nsDecoderStateMachine is the
class that needs to be implemented and it gets run on the state
machine thread.

The state machine thread has one event that is dispatched to it (the
implementation of nsDecoderStateMachine) and that event runs for the
lifetime of the playback of the resource. State shared between threads
is synchronised with the main thread via a monitor held by the
nsBuiltinDecoder object.

The state machine thread event consist of a Run method which is an
infinite loop that performs the decoding operation and checks the
state that the state machine is in and processes operations on that
state.

The Main thread controls the decode state machine by setting the value
of a mPlayState variable and notifying on the monitor based on the
high level player actions required (Seek, Pause, Play, etc).

The player states are the states requested by the client through the
DOM API.  They represent the desired state of the player, while the
decoder's state represents the actual state of the decoder.

The high level state of the player is maintained via a PlayState value. 
It can have the following states:

START
  The decoder has been initialized but has no resource loaded.
PAUSED
  A request via the API has been received to pause playback.
LOADING
  A request via the API has been received to load a resource.
PLAYING
  A request via the API has been received to start playback.
SEEKING
  A request via the API has been received to start seeking.
COMPLETED
  Playback has completed.
SHUTDOWN
  The decoder is about to be destroyed.

State transition occurs when the Media Element calls the Play, Seek,
etc methods on the nsBuiltinDecoder object. When the transition
occurs nsBuiltinDecoder then calls the methods on the decoder state
machine object to cause it to behave appropriate to the play state.

An implementation of the nsDecoderStateMachine class is the event
that gets dispatched to the state machine thread. It has the following states:

DECODING_METADATA
  The media headers are being loaded, and things like framerate, etc are
  being determined, and the first frame of audio/video data is being decoded.
DECODING
  The decode and audio threads are started and video frames displayed at
  the required time. 
SEEKING
  A seek operation is in progress.
BUFFERING
  Decoding is paused while data is buffered for smooth playback.
COMPLETED
  The resource has completed decoding, but not finished playback. 
SHUTDOWN
  The decoder object is about to be destroyed.

The following result in state transitions.

Shutdown()
  Clean up any resources the nsDecoderStateMachine owns.
Decode()
  Start decoding media data.
Buffer
  This is not user initiated. It occurs when the
  available data in the stream drops below a certain point.
Complete
  This is not user initiated. It occurs when the
  stream is completely decoded.
Seek(float)
  Seek to the time position given in the resource.

                                v Shutdown()      |
                                |                 |
                                ------------>-----|

The following represents the states that the nsBuiltinDecoder object
can be in, and the valid states the nsDecoderStateMachine can be in at that
time:

player LOADING   decoder DECODING_METADATA
player PLAYING   decoder DECODING, BUFFERING, SEEKING, COMPLETED
player PAUSED    decoder DECODING, BUFFERING, SEEKING, COMPLETED
player SEEKING   decoder SEEKING
player COMPLETED decoder SHUTDOWN
player SHUTDOWN  decoder SHUTDOWN

The general sequence of events is:

1) The video element calls Load on nsMediaDecoder. This creates the
   state machine thread and starts the channel for downloading the
   file. It instantiates and starts the nsDecoderStateMachine. The
   high level LOADING state is entered, which results in the decode
   state machine to start decoding metadata. These are the headers
   that give the video size, framerate, etc.  It returns immediately
   to the calling video element.

2) When the metadata has been loaded by the decode thread it will call
   a method on the video element object to inform it that this step is
   done, so it can do the things required by the video specification
   at this stage. The decoder then continues to decode the first frame
   of data.

3) When the first frame of data has been successfully decoded it calls
   a method on the video element object to inform it that this step
   has been done, once again so it can do the required things by the
   video specification at this stage.

   This results in the high level state changing to PLAYING or PAUSED
   depending on any user action that may have occurred.

   The decode thread plays audio and video, if the correct frame time
   comes around and the decoder play state is PLAYING.
   
a/v synchronisation is handled by the nsDecoderStateMachine implementation.

The Shutdown method on nsBuiltinDecoder can spin the event loop as it
waits for threads to complete. Spinning the event loop is a bad thing
to happen during certain times like destruction of the media
element. To work around this the Shutdown method does nothing but
queue an event to the main thread to perform the actual Shutdown. This
way the shutdown can occur at a safe time.

This means the owning object of a nsBuiltinDecoder object *MUST* call
Shutdown when destroying the nsBuiltinDecoder object.
