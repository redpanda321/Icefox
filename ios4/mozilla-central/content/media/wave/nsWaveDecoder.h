/*
  nsWaveDecoder provides an implementation of the abstract nsMediaDecoder
  class that supports parsing and playback of Waveform Audio (WAVE) chunks
  embedded in Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) bitstreams as
  specified by the Multimedia Programming Interface and Data Specification
  1.0.

  Each decoder instance starts one thread (the playback thread).  A single
  nsWaveStateMachine event is dispatched to this thread to start the
  thread's state machine running.  The Run method of the event is a loop
  that executes the current state.  The state can be changed by the state
  machine, or from the main thread via threadsafe methods on the event.
  During playback, the playback thread reads data from the network and
  writes it to the audio backend, attempting to keep the backend's audio
  buffers full.  It is also responsible for seeking, buffering, and
  pausing/resuming audio.

  The decoder also owns an nsMediaStream instance that provides a threadsafe
  blocking interface to read from network channels.  The state machine is
  the primary user of this stream and holds a weak (raw) pointer to it as
  the thread, state machine, and stream's lifetimes are all managed by the
  decoder.

  nsWaveStateMachine has the following states:

  LOADING_METADATA
    RIFF/WAVE chunks are being read from the stream, the metadata describing
    the audio data is parsed.

  BUFFERING
    Playback is paused while waiting for additional data.

  PLAYING
    If data is available in the stream and the audio backend can consume
    more data, it is read from the stream and written to the audio backend.
    Sleep until approximately half of the backend's buffers have drained.

  SEEKING
    Decoder is seeking to a specified time in the media.

  PAUSED
    Pause the audio backend, then wait for a state transition.

  ENDED
    Expected PCM data (or stream EOF) reached, wait for the audio backend to
    play any buffered data, then wait for shutdown.

  ERROR
    Metadata loading/parsing failed, wait for shutdown.

  SHUTDOWN
    Close the audio backend and return from the run loop.

  State transitions within the state machine are:

  LOADING_METADATA -> PLAYING
                   -> PAUSED
                   -> ERROR

  BUFFERING        -> PLAYING
                   -> PAUSED

  PLAYING          -> BUFFERING
                   -> ENDED

  SEEKING          -> PLAYING
                   -> PAUSED

  PAUSED           -> waits for caller to play, seek, or shutdown

  ENDED            -> waits for caller to shutdown

  ERROR            -> waits for caller to shutdown

  SHUTDOWN         -> exits state machine

  In addition, the following methods cause state transitions:

  Shutdown(), Play(), Pause(), Seek(float)

  The decoder implementation is currently limited to Linear PCM encoded
  audio data with one or two channels of 8- or 16-bit samples at sample
  rates from 100 Hz to 96 kHz.  The number of channels is limited by what
  the audio backend (sydneyaudio via nsAudioStream) currently supports.  The
  supported sample rate is artificially limited to arbitrarily selected sane
  values.  Support for additional channels (and other new features) would
  require extending nsWaveDecoder to support parsing the newer
  WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE chunk format.
