/**
 * Notes on transforms in Mozilla and the SVG code.
 *
 * It's important to note that the matrix convention used in the SVG standard
 * is the opposite convention to the one used in the Mozilla code or, more
 * specifically, the convention used in Thebes code (code using gfxMatrix).
 * Whereas the SVG standard uses the column vector convention, Thebes code uses
 * the row vector convention. Thus, whereas in the SVG standard you have
 * [M1][M2][M3]|p|, in Thebes you have |p|'[M3]'[M2]'[M1]'. In other words, the
 * following are equivalent:
 *
 *                       / a1 c1 tx1 \   / a2 c2 tx2 \   / a3 c3 tx3 \   / x \
 * SVG:                  | b1 d1 ty1 |   | b2 d2 ty2 |   | b3 d3 ty3 |   | y |
 *                       \  0  0   1 /   \  0  0   1 /   \  0  0   1 /   \ 1 /
 *
 *                       /  a3  b3 0 \   /  a2  b2 0 \   /  a1  b1 0 \
 * Thebes:   [ x y 1 ]   |  c3  d3 0 |   |  c2  d2 0 |   |  c1  d1 0 |
 *                       \ tx3 ty3 1 /   \ tx2 ty2 1 /   \ tx1 ty1 1 /
 *
 * Because the Thebes representation of a transform is the transpose of the SVG
 * representation, our transform order must be reversed when representing SVG
 * transforms using gfxMatrix in the SVG code. Since the SVG implementation
 * stores and obtains matrices in SVG order, to do this we must pre-multiply
 * gfxMatrix objects that represent SVG transforms instead of post-multiplying
 * them as we would for matrices using SVG's column vector convention.
 * Pre-multiplying may look wrong if you're only familiar with the SVG
 * convention, but in that case hopefully the above explanation clears things
 * up.
