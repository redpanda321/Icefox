This is a local copy of the WebGL conformance suite.

  SVN revision: 11955

The canonical location for this testsuite is:

  https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/sdk/tests/

All files and directories in this directory, with the exceptions listed below, come from
upstream and should not be modified without corresponding upstream fixes and/or a
patch file in the "patches" directory. The exceptions (the Mozilla-specific files) are:
 * README.mozilla (this file)
 * failing_tests.txt
 * Makefile.in
 * the "mozilla" directory, if any
 * the "patches" directory, if any

Moreover, the files named 00_test_list.txt are temporarily renamed to 00_testFIXME_list.txt to work around bug 584611, quote:
> In mochitest, we tell people that mochitests should start with test_.  The
> actual truth is that we match anything with a test_ in it.

The "mozilla" directory contains integration of this test suite into Mozilla's
testing system.
