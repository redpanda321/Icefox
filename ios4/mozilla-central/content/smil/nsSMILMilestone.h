/*
 * A significant moment in an nsSMILTimedElement's lifetime where a sample is
 * required.
 *
 * Animations register the next milestone in their lifetime with the time
 * container that they belong to. When the animation controller goes to run
 * a sample it first visits all the animations that have a registered milestone
 * in order of their milestone times. This allows interdependencies between
 * animations to be correctly resolved and events to fire in the proper order.
 *
 * A distinction is made between a milestone representing the end of an interval
 * and any other milestone. This is because if animation A ends at time t, and
 * animation B begins at the same time t (or has some other significant moment
 * such as firing a repeat event), SMIL's endpoint-exclusive timing model
 * implies that the interval end occurs first. In fact, interval ends can be
 * thought of as ending an infinitesimally small time before t. Therefore,
 * A should be sampled before B.
 *
 * Furthermore, this distinction between sampling the end of an interval and
 * a regular sample is used within the timing model (specifically in
 * nsSMILTimedElement) to ensure that all intervals ending at time t are sampled
 * before any new intervals are entered so that we have a fully up-to-date set
 * of instance times available before committing to a new interval. Once an
 * interval is entered, the begin time is fixed.
