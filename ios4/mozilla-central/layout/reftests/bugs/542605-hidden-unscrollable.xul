	a clipping problem in the cairo-win32 show-glyphs
	implementation was causing the text on the button
	to be clipped out. The clip was null and we weren't
	reseting the clip causing us to use the clip of the
	input element. Not using -moz-hidden-unscrollable
	causes this problem to show up for reasons unknown.
