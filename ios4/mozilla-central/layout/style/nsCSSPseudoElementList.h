/* atom list for CSS pseudo-elements */

/*
 * This file contains the list of nsIAtoms and their values for CSS
 * pseudo-elements.  It is designed to be used as inline input to
 * nsCSSPseudoElements.cpp *only* through the magic of C preprocessing.  All
 * entries must be enclosed either in the macro CSS_PSEUDO_ELEMENT;
 * these macros will have cruel and unusual things done to them.  The
 * entries should be kept in some sort of logical order.
 *
 * Code including this file MUST define CSS_PSEUDO_ELEMENT, which takes
 * three parameters:
 * name_  : The C++ identifier used for the atom (which will be a member
 *          of nsCSSPseudoElements)
 * value_ : The pseudo-element as a string, with single-colon syntax,
 *          used as the string value of the atom.
 * flags_ : A bitfield containing flags defined in nsCSSPseudoElements.h
