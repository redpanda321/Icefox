   * Alpha, beta and gamma are Tait-Bryan angles (Z-X'-Y''), that is they correspond to
   * yaw, pitch and roll in flight coordinates. More specifically, assume the device
   * is resting face up on a flat surface (its screen is pointing straight up). Then
   * the X axis points to the right when looking at the screen, the Y axis points up
   * when looking at the screen, and the Z axis points toward you when looking at
   * the screen. Alpha/beta/gamma then define the device's orientation by applying
   * the following rotations to the device in order:
   *
   * 1) Rotate it by alpha degrees around its Z axis (like a compass, or like changing
   *    the yaw of an aircraft, assuming the Y axis is the nose of the craft); alpha
   *    is in [0,360).
   * 2) Rotate it by beta degrees around its X axis (tilting the top of the device
   *    towards or away from you, like pitching an aircraft); beta is in [-180,180).
   * 3) Rotate it by gamma degrees around its Y axis (tilting it sideways, like
   *    rolling an aircraft); gamma is in [-90,90).
