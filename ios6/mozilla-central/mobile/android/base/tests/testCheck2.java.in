         * include:
         * - scroll on one axis followed by scroll on another axis
         * - pinch zoom (in and out)
         * - double-tap zoom (in and out)
         * - multi-fling panning with different velocities on each fling
         *
         * this checkerboarding metric is going to be more of a "functional" style test than
         * a "unit" style test; i.e. it covers a little bit of a lot of things to measure
         * overall performance, but doesn't really allow identifying which part is slow.
