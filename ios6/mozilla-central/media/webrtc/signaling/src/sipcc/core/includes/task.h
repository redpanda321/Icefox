 *--------------------DEPRECATED FILE-------------------------------
 *
 * As part of Skittles project this file is deprecated.
 * DO NOT add anything to this file.
 * The contents of this file are really platform specific and
 * have moved to phntask.h under
 *    src-bcm-tnp/h/phntask.h for CNU phones.
 *    src-arm-79xx/phntask.h  for IRX phones.
 *
 * If you are doing SYNC merges _DO_ _NOT_ merge anything from parent
 * This file is kept here because it comes from parent/grand parent branches
 * and will not be removed from clearcase till Skittles collapses.
 * [The fAQ on cc tools contains details of why ]
 *
 * If you have questions send email to skittles-dev
