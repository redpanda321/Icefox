/**
 * Platform-non-specific, generalized gesture event listener. This class
 * intercepts all touches events on their way to AsyncPanZoomController and
 * determines whether or not they are part of a gesture.
 *
 * For example, seeing that two fingers are on the screen means that the user
 * wants to do a pinch gesture, so we don't forward the touches along to
 * AsyncPanZoomController since it will think that they are just trying to pan
 * the screen. Instead, we generate a PinchGestureInput and send that. If the
 * touch event is not part of a gesture, we just return nsEventStatus_eIgnore
 * and AsyncPanZoomController is expected to handle it.
 *
 * Android doesn't use this class because it has its own built-in gesture event
 * listeners that should generally be preferred.
