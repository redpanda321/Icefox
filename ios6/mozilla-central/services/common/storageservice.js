 * STORAGE SERVICE OVERVIEW
 *
 * The storage service is effectively a key-value store where each value is a
 * well-defined envelope that stores specific metadata along with a payload.
 * These values are called Basic Storage Objects, or BSOs. BSOs are organized
 * into named groups called collections.
 *
 * The service also provides ancillary APIs not related to storage, such as
 * looking up the set of stored collections, current quota usage, etc.

/**
 * The data type stored in the storage service.
 *
 * A Basic Storage Object (BSO) is the primitive type stored in the storage
 * service. BSO's are simply maps with a well-defined set of keys.
 *
 * BSOs belong to named collections.
 *
 * A single BSO consists of the following fields:
 *
 *   id - An identifying string. This is how a BSO is uniquely identified within
 *     a single collection.
 *   modified - Integer milliseconds since Unix epoch BSO was modified.
 *   payload - String contents of BSO. The format of the string is undefined
 *     (although JSON is typically used).
 *   ttl - The number of seconds to keep this record.
 *   sortindex - Integer indicating relative importance of record within the
 *     collection.
 *
 * The constructor simply creates an empty BSO having the specified ID (which
 * can be null or undefined). It also takes an optional collection. This is
 * purely for convenience.
 *
 * This type is meant to be a dumb container and little more.
 *
 * @param id
 *        (string) ID of BSO. Can be null.
 *        (string) Collection BSO belongs to. Can be null;

 *
 *   notFound - True if the requested URI or resource does not exist.
 *
 *   conflict - True if the server reported that a resource being operated on
 *     was in conflict. If this occurs, the client should typically wait a
 *     little and try the request again.
 *
 *   requestTooLarge - True if the request was too large for the server. If
 *     this happens on batch requests, the client should retry the request with
 *     smaller batches.
 *
 *   network - A network error prevented this request from succeeding. If set,
 *     it will be an Error thrown by the Gecko network stack. If set, it could
 *     mean that the request could not be performed or that an error occurred
 *     when the request was in flight. It is also possible the request
 *     succeeded on the server but the response was lost in transit.
 *
 *   authentication - If defined, an authentication error has occurred. If
 *     defined, it will be an Error instance. If seen, the client should not
 *     retry the request without first correcting the authentication issue.
 *
 *   client - An error occurred which was the client's fault. This typically
 *     means the code in this file is buggy.
 *
 *   server - An error occurred on the server. In the ideal world, this should

/**
 * Represents a single request to the storage service.

 * Instances of this type are returned by the APIs on StorageServiceClient.
 * They should not be created outside of StorageServiceClient.
 *
 * This type encapsulates common storage API request and response handling.
 * Metadata required to perform the request is stored inside each instance and
 * should be treated as invisible by consumers.
 *
 * A number of "public" properties are exposed to allow clients to further
 * customize behavior. These are documented below.
 *
 * Some APIs in StorageServiceClient define their own types which inherit from
 * this one. Read the API documentation to see which types those are and when
 * they apply.
 *
 * This type wraps RESTRequest rather than extending it. The reason is mainly
 * to avoid the fragile base class problem. We implement considerable extra
 * functionality on top of RESTRequest and don't want this to accidentally
 * trample on RESTRequest's members.
 *
 * If this were a C++ class, it and StorageServiceClient would be friend
 * classes. Each touches "protected" APIs of the other. Thus, each should be
 * considered when making changes to the other.
 *
 * Usage
 * =====
 *
 * When you obtain a request instance, it is waiting to be dispatched. It may
 * have additional settings available for tuning. See the documentation in
 * StorageServiceClient for more.
 *
 * There are essentially two types of requests: "basic" and "streaming."
 * "Basic" requests encapsulate the traditional request-response paradigm:
 * a request is issued and we get a response later once the full response
 * is available. Most of the APIs in StorageServiceClient issue these "basic"
 * requests. Streaming requests typically involve the transport of multiple
 * BasicStorageObject instances. When a new BSO instance is available, a
 * callback is fired.
 *
 * For basic requests, the general flow looks something like:
 *
 *   // Obtain a new request instance.
 *   let request = client.getCollectionInfo();
 *
 *   // Install a handler which provides callbacks for request events. The most
 *   // important is `onComplete`, which is called when the request has
 *   // finished and the response is completely received.
 *   request.handler = {
 *     onComplete: function onComplete(error, request) {
 *       // Do something.
 *     }
 *   };
 *
 *   // Send the request.
 *   request.dispatch();
 *
 * Alternatively, we can install the onComplete handler when calling dispatch:
 *
 *   let request = client.getCollectionInfo();
 *   request.dispatch(function onComplete(error, request) {
 *     // Handle response.
 *   });
 *
 * Please note that installing an `onComplete` handler as the argument to
 * `dispatch()` will overwrite an existing `handler`.
 *
 * In both of the above example, the two `request` variables are identical. The
 * original `StorageServiceRequest` is passed into the callback so callers
 * don't need to rely on closures.
 *
 * Most of the complexity for onComplete handlers is error checking.
 *
 * The first thing you do in your onComplete handler is ensure no error was
 * seen:
 *
 *   function onComplete(error, request) {
 *     if (error) {
 *       // Handle error.
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * If `error` is defined, it will be an instance of
 * `StorageServiceRequestError`. An error will be set if the request didn't
 * complete successfully. This means the transport layer must have succeeded
 * and the application protocol (HTTP) must have returned a successful status
 * code (2xx and some 3xx). Please see the documentation for
 * `StorageServiceRequestError` for more.
 *
 * A robust error handler would look something like:
 *
 *   function onComplete(error, request) {
 *     if (error) {
 *       if (error.network) {
 *         // Network error encountered!
 *       } else if (error.server) {
 *         // Something went wrong on the server (HTTP 5xx).
 *       } else if (error.authentication) {
 *         // Server rejected request due to bad credentials.
 *       } else if (error.serverModified) {
 *         // The conditional request was rejected because the server has newer
 *         // data than what the client reported.
 *       } else if (error.conflict) {
 *         // The server reported that the operation could not be completed
 *         // because another client is also updating it.
 *       } else if (error.requestTooLarge) {
 *         // The server rejected the request because it was too large.
 *       } else if (error.notFound) {
 *         // The requested resource was not found.
 *       } else if (error.client) {
 *         // Something is wrong with the client's request. You should *never*
 *         // see this, as it means this client is likely buggy. It could also
 *         // mean the server is buggy or misconfigured. Either way, something
 *         // is buggy.
 *       }
 *
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Handle successful case.
 *   }
 *
 * If `error` is null, the request completed successfully. There may or may not
 * be additional data available on the request instance.
 *
 * For requests that obtain data, this data is typically made available through
 * the `resultObj` property on the request instance. The API that was called
 * will install its own response hander and ensure this property is decoded to
 * what you expect.
 *
 * Conditional Requests
 * --------------------
 *
 * Many of the APIs on `StorageServiceClient` support conditional requests.
 * That is, the client defines the last version of data it has (the version
 * comes from a previous response from the server) and sends this as part of
 * the request.
 *
 * For query requests, if the server hasn't changed, no new data will be
 * returned. If issuing a conditional query request, the caller should check
 * the `notModified` property on the request in the response callback. If this
 * property is true, the server has no new data and there is obviously no data
 * on the response.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   let request = client.getCollectionInfo();
 *   request.locallyModifiedVersion = Date.now() - 60000;
 *   request.dispatch(function onComplete(error, request) {
 *     if (error) {
 *       // Handle error.
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 *     if (request.notModified) {
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 *     let info = request.resultObj;
 *     // Do stuff.
 *   });
 *
 * For modification requests, if the server has changed, the request will be
 * rejected. When this happens, `error`will be defined and the `serverModified`
 * property on it will be true.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   let request = client.setBSO(bso);
 *   request.locallyModifiedVersion = bso.modified;
 *   request.dispatch(function onComplete(error, request) {
 *     if (error) {
 *       if (error.serverModified) {
 *         // Server data is newer! We should probably fetch it and apply
 *         // locally.
 *       }
 *
 *       return;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Handle success.
 *   });
 *
 * Future Features
 * ---------------
 *
 * The current implementation does not support true streaming for things like
 * multi-BSO retrieval. However, the API supports it, so we should be able
 * to implement it transparently.

 * issued. At most one request is allowed to be in-flight at once. This is to
 * avoid potential conflicts on the server. And, in the case of conditional
 * requests, it prevents requests from being declined due to the server being
 * updated by another request issued by us.
 *
 * If a request errors for any reason, all queued uploads are abandoned and the
 * `finish` callback is invoked as soon as possible. The `successfulIDs` and
 * `failures` properties will contain data from all requests that had this
 * response data. In other words, the IDs have BSOs that were never sent to the
 * server are not lumped in to either property.

 * All request APIs operate by returning a StorageServiceRequest instance. The
 * caller then installs the appropriate callbacks on each instance and then
 * dispatches the request.
 *
 * Each client instance also serves as a controller and coordinator for
 * associated requests. Callers can install listeners for common events on the
 * client and take the appropriate action whenever any associated request
 * observes them. For example, you will only need to register one listener for
 * backoff observation as opposed to one on each request.
 *
 * While not currently supported, a future goal of this type is to support
 * more advanced transport channels - such as SPDY - to allow for faster and
 * more efficient API calls. The API is thus designed to abstract transport
 * specifics away from the caller.
 *
 * Storage API consumers almost certainly have added functionality on top of the
 * storage service. It is encouraged to create a child type which adds
 * functionality to this layer.

  // Event Listener Management |
  //----------------------------

  /**
   * Adds a listener to this client instance.
   *
   * Listeners allow other parties to react to and influence execution of the
   * client instance.
   *
   * An event listener is simply an object that exposes functions which get
   * executed during client execution. Objects can expose 0 or more of the
   * following keys:
   *
   *   onDispatch - Callback notified immediately before a request is
   *     dispatched. This gets called for every outgoing request. The function
   *     receives as its arguments the client instance and the outgoing
   *     StorageServiceRequest. This listener is useful for global
   *     authentication handlers, which can modify the request before it is
   *     sent.
   *
   *   onAuthFailure - This is called when any request has experienced an
   *     authentication failure.
   *
   *     This callback receives the following arguments:
   *
   *       (StorageServiceClient) Client that encountered the auth failure.
   *       (StorageServiceRequest) Request that encountered the auth failure.
   *
   *   onBackoffReceived - This is called when a backoff request is issued by
   *     the server. Backoffs are issued either when the service is completely
   *     unavailable (and the client should abort all activity) or if the server
   *     is under heavy load (and has completed the current request but is
   *     asking clients to be kind and stop issuing requests for a while).
   *
   *     This callback receives the following arguments:
   *
   *       (StorageServiceClient) Client that encountered the backoff.
   *       (StorageServiceRequest) Request that received the backoff.
   *       (number) Integer milliseconds the server is requesting us to back off
   *         for.
   *       (bool) Whether the request completed successfully. If false, the
   *         client should cease sending additional requests immediately, as
   *         they will likely fail. If true, the client is allowed to continue
   *         to put the server in a proper state. But, it should stop and heed
   *         the backoff as soon as possible.
   *
   *   onNetworkError - This is called for every network error that is
   *     encountered.
   *
   *     This callback receives the following arguments:
   *
   *       (StorageServiceClient) Client that encountered the network error.
   *       (StorageServiceRequest) Request that encountered the error.
   *       (Error) Error passed in to RESTRequest's onComplete handler. It has
   *         a result property, which is a Components.Results enumeration.
   *
   *   onQuotaRemaining - This is called if any request sees updated quota
   *     information from the server. This provides an update mechanism so
   *     listeners can immediately find out quota changes as soon as they
   *     are made.
   *
   *     This callback receives the following arguments:
   *
   *       (StorageServiceClient) Client that encountered the quota change.
   *       (StorageServiceRequest) Request that received the quota change.
   *       (number) Integer number of kilobytes remaining for the user.
