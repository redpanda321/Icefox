# SPDY Server for node.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/node-spdy.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [SPDY](http://www.chromium.org/spdy) servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that doesn't support SPDY yet).

## Node+OpenSSL building

At the moment node-spdy requires zlib dictionary support, which will come to
node.js only in 0.7.x version. To build 0.7.x version follow instructions below:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
cd node
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.node/dev # <- or any other dir

make install -j4 # in -jN, N is number of CPU cores on your machine

# Add node's bin to PATH env variable
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.node/dev/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

#
# You have working node 0.7.x + NPN now !!!
#
```

## Usage

```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-cert.pem'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-csr.pem')
};

spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

spdy.listen(443);
```

## API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer. For example,
`require('express').HTTPSServer` given that as base class you'll get a server
compatible with [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) API.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server or express.HTTPSServer],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But two
custom properties are added to both of them: `streamID` and `isSpdy`. The first
one indicates on which spdy stream are sitting request and response. Latter one
is always true and can be checked to ensure that incoming request wasn't
received by HTTPS callback.

### Push streams

It's possible to initiate 'push' stream to send content to client, before one'll
request it.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  var headers = { 'content-type': 'application/javascript' };
  res.send('/main.js', headers, function(err, stream) {
    if (err) return;

    stream.end('alert("hello from push stream!");');
  });

  res.end('<script src="/main.js"></script>');
}).listen(443);
```

`.push('full or relative url', { ... headers ... }, callback)`

You can use either full ( `http://host/path` ) or relative ( `/path` ) urls with
`.push()`. `headers` are the same as for regular response object. `callback`
will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and `stream`
(stream object have API compatible with a
[net.Socket](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/net.html#net.Socket) ).

### Options

All options supported by
[tls](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/tls.html#tls.createServer) are working
with node-spdy. In addition, `maxStreams` options is available. it allows you
controlling [maximum concurrent streams][http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-protocol/spdy-protocol-draft2#TOC-SETTINGS]
protocol option (if client will start more streams than that limit, RST_STREAM
will be sent for each additional stream).
