/**
 * Test behavior of 'align-self:auto' (Bug 696253)
 * ===============================================
 *
 * The value "align-self: auto" is special.  It's the initial value for
 * "align-self", and it's supposed to compute to the parent's "align-items" value.
 *
 * However, to allow its style-struct to be shared by default, we internally
 * make it compute to a special "auto" enumerated value, and then we resolve that
 * to the correct value by examining the parent's style struct whenever we actually
 * need to use it.
 *
 * This test makes sure that optimization isn't detectable to content.
 *
 * One special case of this is inheritance -- e.g.:
 *
 *  <html style="align-items: baseline">
 *    <body style="align-self: auto; align-items: center">
 *      <div style="align-self: inherit">
 *
 * In that example, the child div's "inherit" should get the _computed_ value
 * of "align-self" on the body.  That, in turn, is "auto", so it should compute to
 * its parent's "align-items" value, which is "baseline".  So we need to end up 
 * with a computed "align-self" value of "baseline" on the child.
 *
 * (NOTE: if we instead allowed the child div to directly inherit the value "auto"
 * from its parent, then we'd get different & incorrect behavior. The div would
 * resolve that inherited "auto" value to its own parent's "align-items" value,
 * which is "center" -- not "baseline".)
 *
 * This mochitest tests that situation and a few other similar tricky situations.
