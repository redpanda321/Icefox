/* *************** SPS Sampler Information ****************
 *
 * SPS is an always on profiler that takes fast and low overheads samples
 * of the program execution using only userspace functionity for portability.
 * The goal of this module is to provide performance data in a generic
 * cross platform way without requiring custom tools or kernel support.
 *
 * Non goals: Support features that are platform specific or replace
 *            platform specific profilers.
 *
 * Samples are collected to form a timeline with optional timeline event (markers)
 * used for filtering.
 *
 * SPS collects samples in a platform independant way by using a speudo stack abstraction
 * of the real program stack by using 'sample stack frames'. When a sample is collected
 * all active sample stack frames and the program counter are recorded.
 */

/* *************** SPS Sampler File Format ****************
 *
 * Simple new line seperated tag format:
 * S      -> BOF tags EOF
 * tags   -> tag tags
 * tag    -> CHAR - STRING
 *
 * Tags:
 * 's' - Sample tag followed by the first stack frame followed by 0 or more 'c' tags.
 * 'c' - Continue Sample tag gives remaining tag element. If a 'c' tag is seen without
 *         a preceding 's' tag it should be ignored. This is to support the behavior
 *         of circular buffers.
 *         If the 'stackwalk' feature is enabled this tag will have the format
 *         'l-<library name>@<hex address>' and will expect an external tool to translate
 *         the tag into something readable through a symbolication processing step.
 * 'm' - Timeline marker. Zero or more may appear before a 's' tag.
 * 'l' - Information about the program counter library and address. Post processing
 *         can include function and source line. If built with leaf data enabled
 *         this tag will describe the last 'c' tag.
 * 'r' - Responsiveness tag following an 's' tag. Gives an indication on how well the
 *          application is responding to the event loop. Lower is better.
 * 't' - Elapse time since recording started.
