Esperanto hyphenation patterns

(more info about the licence to be added later)

% This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and resulted from
% semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into UTF-8 in June 2008.
%
% See http://tug.org/tex-hyphen and other files in the package
%
% However, this file does not comply with rules of other patterns
% as it still uses TeX macros, and a dedicated converter would be needed
% to convert patterns into OponOffice-friendly form for example.
%
% But it should work OK with both 8-bit engines (TeX, pdfTeX, ...)
% as well as with native UTF-8 ones (XeTeX, LuaTeX, ...)
