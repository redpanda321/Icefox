Upgrade notes:

1. Get the Orion client source code from:
http://www.eclipse.org/orion

2. Install Dryice from:
https://github.com/mozilla/dryice

You also need nodejs for Dryice to run:
http://nodejs.org

3. Copy Makefile.dryice.js to:
org.eclipse.orion.client/bundles/

4. Execute Makefile.dryice.js. You should get orion.js and orion.css.

5. Copy the two files back here.

6. Make a new build of Firefox.
