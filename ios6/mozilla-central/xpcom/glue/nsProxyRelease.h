/**
 * Class to safely handle main-thread-only pointers off the main thread.
 *
 * Classes like XPCWrappedJS are main-thread-only, which means that it is
 * forbidden to call methods on instances of these classes off the main thread.
 * For various reasons (see bug 771074), this restriction recently began to
 * apply to AddRef/Release as well.
 *
 * This presents a problem for consumers that wish to hold a callback alive
 * on non-main-thread code. A common example of this is the proxy callback
 * pattern, where non-main-thread code holds a strong-reference to the callback
 * object, and dispatches new Runnables (also with a strong reference) to the
 * main thread in order to execute the callback. This involves several AddRef
 * and Release calls on the other thread, which is (now) verboten.
 *
 * The basic idea of this class is to introduce a layer of indirection.
 * nsMainThreadPtrHolder is a threadsafe reference-counted class that internally
 * maintains one strong reference to the main-thread-only object. It must be
 * instantiated on the main thread (so that the AddRef of the underlying object
 * happens on the main thread), but consumers may subsequently pass references
 * to the holder anywhere they please. These references are meant to be opaque
 * when accessed off-main-thread (assertions enforce this).
 *
 * The semantics of nsRefPtr<nsMainThreadPtrHolder<T> > would be cumbersome, so
 * we also introduce nsMainThreadPtrHandle<T>, which is conceptually identical
 * to the above (though it includes various convenience methods). The basic
 * pattern is as follows.
 *
 * // On the main thread:
 * nsCOMPtr<nsIFooCallback> callback = ...;
 * nsMainThreadPtrHandle<nsIFooCallback> callbackHandle =
 *   new nsMainThreadPtrHolder<nsIFooCallback>(callback);
 * // Pass callbackHandle to structs/classes that might be accessed on other
 * // threads.
 *
 * All structs and classes that might be accessed on other threads should store
 * an nsMainThreadPtrHandle<T> rather than an nsCOMPtr<T>.
