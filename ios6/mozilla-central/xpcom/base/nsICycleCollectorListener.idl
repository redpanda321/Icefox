/** Interface to pass to the cycle collector to get information about

 * call to begin(); then for every node in the graph a call to either
 * noteRefCountedObject() or noteGCedObject(), followed by calls to
 * noteEdge() for every edge starting at that node; then a call to
 * beginResults(); then a mixture of describeRoot() for ref counted
 * nodes the CC has identified as roots and describeGarbage() for
 * nodes the CC has identified as garbage.  Ref counted nodes that are
 * not identified as either roots or garbage are neither, and have a
 * known edges count equal to their ref count.  Finally, there will be
 * a call to end().  If begin() returns an error none of the other
 * functions will be called.
