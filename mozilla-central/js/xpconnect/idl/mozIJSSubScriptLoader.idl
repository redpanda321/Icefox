     *            resource:, or chrome: url, and MUST be local.
     * @param obj an optional object to evaluate the script onto, it
     *            defaults to the global object of the caller.
     * @param charset optionally specifies the character encoding of
     *                the file. If absent, the file is interpreted
     *                as ASCII.
     * @retval rv the value returned by the sub-script
