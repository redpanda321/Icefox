[mozdevice](https://github.com/mozilla/mozbase/tree/master/mozdevice) provides
an interface to interact with a remote device such as an Android phone connected
to a workstation. Currently there are two implementations of the interface: one
uses a TCP-based protocol to communicate with a server running on the device,
another uses Android's adb utility.
