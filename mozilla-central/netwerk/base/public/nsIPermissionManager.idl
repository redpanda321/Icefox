/**

 *
 * This service broadcasts the following notification when the permission list

 *
 * topic  : "perm-changed" (PERM_CHANGE_NOTIFICATION)
 *          broadcast whenever the permission list changes in some way. there
 *          are four possible data strings for this notification; one
 *          notification will be broadcast for each change, and will involve
 *          a single permission.
 * subject: an nsIPermission interface pointer representing the permission object
 *          that changed.
 * data   : "deleted"
 *          a permission was deleted. the subject is the deleted permission.
 *          "added"
 *          a permission was added. the subject is the added permission.
 *          "changed"
 *          a permission was changed. the subject is the new permission.
 *          "cleared"
 *          the entire permission list was cleared. the subject is null.
