% Differences with Ottoman patterns:
% - adapted for the use on modern TeX engines, using UTF-8 charactes
% - only letters for Modern Turkish + âîû (the first one often needed, the other two don't hurt)
% - (if needed, support for Ottoman Turkish might be provided separately under language code 'ota')
%
% Changes:
% - 2008-06-25/27/28 - create this file by adapting Ottoman rules for modern Turkish
% - 2011-08-10 - add LPPL licence with permission of Pierre A. MacKay
