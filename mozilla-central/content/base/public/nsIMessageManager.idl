/**
 * Message managers provide a way for chrome-privileged JS code to
 * communicate with each other, even across process boundaries.
 *
 * Message managers are separated into "parent side" and "child side".
 * These don't always correspond to process boundaries, but can.  For
 * each child-side message manager, there is always exactly one
 * corresponding parent-side message manager that it sends messages
 * to.  However, for each parent-side message manager, there may be
 * either one or many child-side managers it can message.
 *
 * Message managers that always have exactly one "other side" are of
 * type nsIMessageSender.  Parent-side message managers that have many
 * "other sides" are of type nsIMessageBroadcaster.
 *
 * Child-side message managers can send synchronous messages to their
 * parent side, but not the other way around.
 *
 * There are two realms of message manager hierarchies.  One realm
 * approximately corresponds to DOM elements, the other corresponds to
 * process boundaries.
 *
 * Message managers corresponding to DOM elements
 * ==============================================
 *
 * In this realm of message managers, there are
 *  - "frame message managers" which correspond to frame elements
 *  - "window message managers" which correspond to top-level chrome
 *    windows
 *  - the "global message manager", on the parent side.  See below.
 *
 * The DOM-realm message managers can communicate in the ways shown by
 * the following diagram.  The parent side and child side can
 * correspond to process boundaries, but don't always.
 *
 *  Parent side                         Child side
 * -------------                       ------------
 *  global MMg
 *   |
 *   +-->window MMw1
 *   |    |
 *   |    +-->frame MMp1_1<------------>frame MMc1_1
 *   |    |
 *   |    +-->frame MMp1_2<------------>frame MMc1_2
 *   |    ...
 *   |
 *   +-->window MMw2
 *   ...
 *
 * For example: a message sent from MMc1_1, from the child side, is
 * sent only to MMp1_1 on the parent side.  However, note that all
 * message managers in the hierarchy above MMp1_1, in this diagram
 * MMw1 and MMg, will also notify their message listeners when the
 * message arrives.

 * For example: a message broadcast through the global MMg on the
 * parent side would be broadcast to MMw1, which would transitively
 * broadcast it to MMp1_1, MM1p_2".  The message would next be
 * broadcast to MMw2, and so on down the hierarchy.
 *
 *   ***** PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY WARNING *****
 * Messages broadcast through the global MM and window MMs can result
 * in messages being dispatched across many OS processes, and to many
 * processes with different permissions.  Great care should be taken
 * when broadcasting.
 *
 * Interfaces
 * ----------
 *
 * The global MMg and window MMw's are message broadcasters implementing
 * nsIMessageBroadcaster while the frame MMp's are simple message senders
 * (nsIMessageSender). Their counterparts in the content processes are
 * message senders implementing nsIContentFrameMessageManager.
 *
 *                    nsIMessageListenerManager
 *                  /                           \
 * nsIMessageSender                               nsIMessageBroadcaster
 *       |
 * nsISyncMessageSender (content process/in-process only)
 *       |
 * nsIContentFrameMessageManager (content process/in-process only)
 *       |
 * nsIInProcessContentFrameMessageManager (in-process only)
 *
 *
 * Message managers in the chrome process can also be QI'ed to nsIFrameScriptLoader.
 *
 *
 * Message managers corresponding to process boundaries
 * ====================================================
 *
 * The second realm of message managers is the "process message
 * managers".  With one exception, these always correspond to process
 * boundaries.  The picture looks like
 *
 *  Parent process                      Child processes
 * ----------------                    -----------------
 *  global PPMM
 *   |
 *   +<----> child PPMM
 *   |
 *   +-->parent PMM1<------------------>child process CMM1
 *   |
 *   +-->parent PMM2<------------------>child process PMM2
 *   ...
 *
 * For example: the parent-process PMM1 sends messages directly to
 * only the child-process CMM1.
 *
 * For example: CMM1 sends messages directly to PMM1.  The global PPMM
 * will also notify their message listeners when the message arrives.
 *
 * For example: messages sent through the global PPMM will be
 * dispatched to the listeners of the same-process, "child PPMM".
 * They will also be broadcast to PPM1, PPM2, etc.
 *
 *   ***** PERFORMANCE AND SECURITY WARNING *****
 * Messages broadcast through the global PPMM can result in messages
 * being dispatched across many OS processes, and to many processes
 * with different permissions.  Great care should be taken when
 * broadcasting.
 *
 * Requests sent to parent-process message listeners should usually
 * have replies scoped to the requesting CPMM.  The following pattern
 * is common
 *
 *  const ParentProcessListener = {
 *    receiveMessage: function(aMessage) {
 *      let childMM = aMessage.target.QueryInterface(Ci.nsIMessageSender);
 *      switch (aMessage.name) {
 *      case "Foo:Request":
 *        // service request
 *        childMM.sendAsyncMessage("Foo:Response", { data });
 *      }
 *    }
 *  };
