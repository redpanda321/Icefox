  The SVG DOM makes use of multiple interface inheritance.
  Since XPCOM only supports single interface inheritance,
  the best thing that we can do is to promise that whenever
  an object implements _this_ interface it will also
  implement the following interfaces. (We then have to QI to
  hop between them.)
