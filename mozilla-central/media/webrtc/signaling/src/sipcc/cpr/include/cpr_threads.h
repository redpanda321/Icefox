 * @param[in]  priority     - thread's execution priority (IGNORED)
 * @param[in]  data         - parameter to pass to startRoutine

/**
 * cprAdjustRelativeThreadPriority
 *
 * @brief The function sets the relative thread priority up or down by the given value.
 *
 * pSIPCC specific important notes:
 * This function is used by pSIPCC to set up the priority for its threads.
 * When pSIPCC creates threads, it requests default priority
 * and then subsequently calls this function to adjust the level to desired
 * value.
 * relPri ranges from -20 (Maximum priority) to +19 (Minimum priority).
 * The relPri values are normalized to Linux Nice levels. This implies
 * that these values must be mapped to a range or values of your OS.
 * For example:
 * if your OS supports thread priorities ranging from 1 to 10 then you
 * could do a simple linear mapping of 40 nice values to 10 values
 * by mapping 1 to 19 and 10 to -20 and so on.
 * The mapping is completely determined by your implementation below.
 * Note that pSIPCC threads must run at a sufficiently higher priority to
 * provide proper signaling cut through times.
 * obviously, signaling cut through ultimately affects the media cut through.
 * pSIPCC also uses virtual timers which require sufficiently high priority
 * to provide accurate timeout behavior.
 * A general guideline is to map the relPri passed such that it is somewhere
 * in between the non critical threads and highly critical threads such as
 * media or timer processing on your system.
 *
 * @param[in] relPri - normalized relative Priority of the thread [-20,+19]
 *
 * @return CPR_SUCCESS or CPR_FAILURE
